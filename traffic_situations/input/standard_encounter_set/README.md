# Standard encounter set

These are the baseline traffic situations as described in the paper [Generating Structured Set of Encounters for Verifying Automated Collision and Grounding Avoidance Systems](https://github.com/dnv-opensource/ship-traffic-generator/blob/ff03400c164852b1cbb7ad2cb0cc7e745c106281/docs/ICMASS23_verfying_caga_systems.pdf). They are also referred to as the "Standard ship encounter set".

The files describing the traffic situations are copied from https://github.com/dnv-opensource/ship-traffic-generator at commit [ff03400c164852b1cbb7ad2cb0cc7e745c106281](https://github.com/dnv-opensource/ship-traffic-generator/tree/ff03400c164852b1cbb7ad2cb0cc7e745c106281).
