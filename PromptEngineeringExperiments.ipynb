       "\"To determine whether the target ship, 'Calethea', is crossing ahead, astern, or neither in relation to the own ship, 'BASTO VI', we need to analyze the given information regarding their positions, courses, and speeds.\\n\\nGiven data:\\n- Own ship ('BASTO VI'): Course = 0.0° (North), Speed = 10.0 knots\\n- Target ship 1 ('Calethea'): Course = 133.2°, Speed = 18.0 knots, Bearing = 280.0° relative, Distance = 6.7 nautical miles\\n\\nFirst, let's understand the bearing of the target ship relative to the own ship. A bearing of 280.0° relative means that 'Calethea' is located to the northwest of 'BASTO VI' when considering the bow of 'BASTO VI' as the reference point (0° or 360° being directly ahead).\\n\\nNext, we consider the courses of both ships:\\n- 'BASTO VI' is moving due north.\\n- 'Calethea' is moving on a course of 133.2°, which is southeast.\\n\\nGiven that 'Calethea' is currently to the northwest of 'BASTO VI' and is moving southeast, it is moving away from a direct line that would intersect the northward path of 'BASTO VI'. \\n\\nTo determine if 'Calethea' will cross ahead or astern of 'BASTO VI', we need to consider the speed and direction of both vessels. 'Calethea' is moving faster (18.0 knots) than 'BASTO VI' (10.0 knots). However, since 'Calethea' is moving in a southeast direction (away from the northward path of 'BASTO VI') and is currently located to the northwest, it is unlikely to cross directly ahead of 'BASTO VI'.\\n\\nGiven the information, 'Calethea' is neither directly crossing ahead nor astern of 'BASTO VI' based on their current courses and speeds. Instead, 'Calethea' is moving away from 'BASTO VI' on a diverging path to the southeast, while 'BASTO VI' continues north.\""
